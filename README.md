# Rize CircleCI

This is an example CircleCI configuration to build a rize (shiny application)
during continuous integration, resulting in a Docker container. The
example comes from the [Mathjax example](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/019-mathjax)
in the rstudio shiny-examples repository.
